    "+ **Part a)** Modify the code above (as suggested by the comments) so it displays a 2x3-panel plot showing the profiles of temperature, salinity, and density and the vertical changes (i.e. \"slopes\" or \"gradients\") for **two** dives 400 and 1236, one overlaid on the other. See LAB01 code for additional examples.  Please plot all data for dive 1236 in black and all data for dive 400 in red.  Both dives come from similar locations in the offshore waters of the Rockall Trough but dive 1236 is from January 2021 and dive 400 is from October 2020.  The figure displayed above is the main result of this question subpart that will be graded. **(6 points)**\n",
    "+ **Part b)** In the Markdown cell below, please describe the differences between the dives.  In particular, identify (with depth ranges) and contrast the permanent 'clines and the seasonal 'clines. **(4 points)**\n",
    "+ **Part c)** In the Markdown cell below, please write a sentence that states the **length scales** of the typcial impact of winds and solar heating over the summer and vertical mixing due to storms over the winter. Justify your answer with specific support from the figures generated above. **(2 points)**"
